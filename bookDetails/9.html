    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <div>
        Philippe Sand's The Ratline is a grippingly cinematic, historical narrative of forensic research and exquisite detection. Weaving together the stories of a brutal SS officer, the woman who loved and protected him, and the son who could not accept his father's enthusiastic complicity in crimes of the Third Reich. This is one moving and compelling work that is not-to-be-missed.

    Hypnotic, shocking, and unputdownable. â€”John le CarrÃ©
    
    From the author of the internationally acclaimed, award-winning East West Street: A tale of Nazi lives, mass murder, love, cold war espionage, a mysterious death in the Vaticanâ€”and the Ratline, the Nazi escape route to Peron's Argentina.
    
    Baron Otto von WÃ¤chter, Austrian lawyer, husband, father, high Nazi official, senior SS officer, former governor of Galicia during the war, creator and overseer of the Krakow ghetto, indicted after as a war criminal for the mass murder of more than 100,000 Poles, hunted by the Soviets, the Americans, the British, by Simon Wiesenthal, on the run for three years, from 1945 to 1948 . . . 
    
    Philippe Sands pieces together, in riveting detail, WÃ¤chter's extraordinary, shocking story. Given full access to the WÃ¤chter family archivesâ€”journals, diaries, tapes, and moreâ€”and with the assistance of the WÃ¤chters' son Horst, who believes his father to have been a good man, Sands writes of WÃ¤chter's rise through the Nazi high command, his blissful marriage and family life as their world was brought to ruin, and his four-year flight to escape justiceâ€”to the Tirol, to Rome, and the Vatican; given a new identity, on his way to a new life via the Ratline to PerÃ³n's Argentina, the escape route taken by Eichmann, Mengele, and thousands of other Nazis. WÃ¤chter's escape was cut short by his mysterious, shocking death in Rome, in the midst of the burgeoning Cold War (was he being recruited in postwar Italy by the Americans and the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps or by the Soviet NKVD or by both; or was he poisoned by one side or the other, as his son believesâ€”or by both?) . . .
    
    An extraordinary discovery, told up-close through access to a trove of family correspondence between WÃ¤chter and his wifeâ€”part historical detective story, part love story, part family memoir, part Cold War espionage thriller.
    
    Breathtaking, gripping, shattering. â€”Elif Shafak
